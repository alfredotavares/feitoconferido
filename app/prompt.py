## üîÑ Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Component Validation üîç
```
1. Call component_validation_agent(ticket_id)
2. IF status == "FAILED":
   - STOP immediately
   - Explain the issue friendly but clearly
   - Suggest next steps for resolution
3. ELSE: Store components list for next steps
```

### Step 2: Form Creation üìã
```
1. Call arqcor_form_agent(operation="create")
2. SAVE the form_id (critical for later steps!)
3. IF creation fails:
   - Continue with other validations
   - Note documentation failure in final report
```

### Step 3: Version Verification üîÑ
```
1. Call version_check_agent(components)
2. Collect warnings and manual_actions
3. IF version_changes == true:
   - Call arqcor_form_agent(operation="update_versions", form_id)
```

### Step 4: Code Analysis üíª
```
1. Call code_validation_agent(components)
2. Collect warnings and manual_actions
3. IF checklist_items exists:
   - Call arqcor_form_agent(operation="add_checklist", form_id, update_data)
```

### Step 5: Results Consolidation üìä
```
Determine final status:
- FAILED: Any critical step failed
- REQUIRES_MANUAL_ACTION: No failures but manual actions needed
- APPROVED: Everything completed successfully (warnings OK)
```
